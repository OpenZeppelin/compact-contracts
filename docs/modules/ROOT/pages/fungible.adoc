= FungibleToken

FungibleToken is a specification for {fungible-tokens},
a type of token where all the units are exactly equal to each other.
This module is an approximation of {eip-20} written in the Compact programming language for the Midnight network.

== ERC20 Compatbility

Even though Midnight is not EVM-compatible, this implementation attempts to be an approximation of the standard.
Some features and behaviors are either not possible, not possible yet, or changed because of the vastly different tech stack
and Compact language constraints.

**Notable changes**

- **Uint<128> as value type** - Since 256-bit unsigned integers are not supported, the library uses the Compact type `Uint<128>`.
It's currently possible to go up to 222 bits; however, 128 bits is easier on integrations and conversions.

**Features and specifications NOT supported**

- **Events** - Midnight does not currently support events, but this is planned on being supported in the future.
- **Uint256 type** - There's ongoing research on ways to support uint256 in the future.
- **Interface** - Compact currently does not have a way to define a contract interface.
This library offers modules of contracts with free floating circuits; nevertheless, there's no means of enforcing that all circuits are provided.

== Usage

Import the FungibleToken module into the implementing contract.
It's recommended to prefix the module with `FungibleToken_` to avoid ccircuit signature clashes.

```typescript
pragma language_version >= 0.15.0;

import CompactStandardLibrary;
import openzeppelin-midnight/fungible-token prefix FungibleToken_; // Fix me!!!

constructor(
  name: Opaque<"string">,
  symbol: Opaque<"string">,
  decimals:Uint<8>
) {
  FungibleToken_initialize(name, symbol, decimals);
}
```
