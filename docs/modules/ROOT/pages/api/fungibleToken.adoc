[[FungibleTokenModule-initialize]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++initialize++#++(name_: Opaque<"string">, symbol_: Opaque<"string">, decimals_: Uint<8>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Initializes the contract by setting the name, symbol, and decimals.

This MUST be called in the implementing contract's constructor.
Failure to do so can lead to an irreparable contract.

Requirements:

- Contract is not initialized.

[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-name]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++name++#++() → Opaque<"string">++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the token name.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.


[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-symbol]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++symbol++#++() → Opaque<"string">++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the symbol of the token.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.


[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-decimals]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++decimals++#++() → Uint<8>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.


[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-totalSupply]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++totalSupply++#++() → Uint<128>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the value of tokens in existence.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.


[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-balanceOf]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++balanceOf++#++(account: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → Uint<128>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the value of tokens owned by `account`.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.


[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-transfer]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++transfer++#++(to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → Boolean++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Moves a `value` amount of tokens from the caller's account to `to`.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not a ContractAddress.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- The caller has a balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-_unsafeTransfer]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_unsafeTransfer++#++(to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → Boolean++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Unsafe variant of <<FungibleTokenModule-transfer,transfer>> which allows transfers to contract addresses.

WARNING: Transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported. Tokens sent to a contract address may become irretrievable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- The caller has a balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-allowance]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++allowance++#++(owner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, spender: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → Uint<128>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through <<FungibleTokenModule-transferFrom,transferFrom>>.
This value changes when <<FungibleTokenModule-approve,approve>> or <<FungibleTokenModule-transferFrom,transferFrom>> are called.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.

[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-approve]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++approve++#++(spender: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → Boolean++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Sets a `value` amount of tokens as allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `spender` is not the zero address.

[.contract-item]
[[FungibleTokenModule-transferFrom]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++transferFrom++#++(from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → Boolean++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Moves `value` tokens from `from` to `to` using the allowance mechanism.
`value` is the deducted from the caller's allowance.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `value`.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `to` is not a ContractAddress.
- The caller has an allowance of ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.

Unsafe variant of <<FungibleTokenModule-transferFrom,transferFrom>> which allows transfers to contract addresses.

WARNING: Transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
Tokens sent to a contract address may become irretrievable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `value`.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- The caller has an allowance of ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.

==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_transfer++#++(from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Moves a `value` amount of tokens from `from` to `to`.
This circuit is equivalent to <<FungibleTokenModule-transfer,transfer>>, and can be used to e.g.
implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `from` is not be the zero address.
- `from` must have at least a balance of `value`.
- `to` must not be the zero address.
- `to` must not be a ContractAddress.

[[FungibleTokenModule-_mint]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_mint++#++(account: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

- `spender` is not the zero address.

[.contract-item]
