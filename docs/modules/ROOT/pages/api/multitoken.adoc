[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-initialize]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++initialize++#++(uri_) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Initializes the contract by setting the base URI for all tokens.

This MUST be called in the implementing contract's constructor.
Failure to do so can lead to an irreparable contract.

Requirements:

- Contract is not initialized.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-uri]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++uri++#++() → Opaque<"string">++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

This implementation returns the same URI for *all* token types.
It relies on the token type ID substitution mechanism defined in the EIP: {erc1155-metadata}.
Clients calling this function must replace the `\{id\}` substring with the actual token type ID.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-balanceOf]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++balanceOf++#++(account: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>) → Uint<128>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the amount of `id` tokens owned by `account`.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.



[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-setApprovalForAll]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++setApprovalForAll++#++(operator: Either<ZSwapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, approved: Boolean) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Enables or disables approval for `operator` to manage all of the caller's assets.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `operator` is not the zero address.


[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-isApprovedForAll]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++balanceOf++#++(account: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, operator: Either<ZSwapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → Boolean++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Queries if `operator` is an authorized operator for `owner`.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.


[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-transferFrom]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++transferFrom++#++(from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Transfers ownership of `value` amount of `id` tokens from `from` to `to`.
The caller must be `from` or approved to transfer on their behalf.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not a ContractAddress.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- Caller must be `from` or approved via `setApprovalForAll`.
- `from` must have an `id` balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_transfer]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_transfer++#++(to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, value: Uint<128>) → Boolean++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Transfers ownership of `value` amount of `id` tokens from `from` to `to`.
Does not impose restrictions on the caller, making it suitable for composition in higher-level contract logic.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not a ContractAddress.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `from` must have an `id` balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_unsafeTransferFrom]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_unsafeTransferFrom++#++(from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Unsafe variant of <<MultiTokenModule-transferFrom,transferFrom>> which allows transfers to contract addresses.
The caller must be `from` or approved to transfer on their behalf.

WARNING: Transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported. Tokens sent to a contract address may become irretrievable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- Caller must be `from` or approved via `setApprovalForAll`.
- `from` must have an `id` balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_unsafeTransfer]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_unsafeTransfer++#++(from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Unsafe variant of <<MultiTokenModule-_transfer,_transfer>> which allows transfers to contract addresses.
Does not impose restrictions on the caller, making it suitable as a low-level building block for advanced contract logic.

WARNING: Transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported. Tokens sent to a contract address may become irretrievable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `from` must have an `id` balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_setURI]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_setURI++#++(newURI: Opaque<"string">) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Sets a new URI for all token types, by relying on the token type ID substitution mechanism defined in the MultiToken standard.
See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata.

By this mechanism, any occurrence of the `\{id\}` substring
in either the URI or any of the values in the JSON file at said URI will be replaced by clients with the token type ID.

For example, the `https://token-cdn-domain/\{id\}.json` URI would be interpreted by clients as
`https://token-cdn-domain/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004cce0.json` for token type ID 0x4cce0.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_mint]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_mint++#++(to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Creates a `value` amount of tokens of type `token_id`, and assigns them to `to`.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `to` is not a ContractAddress

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_unsafeMint]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_unsafeMint++#++(to: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Unsafe variant of `_mint` which allows transfers to contract addresses.

WARNING: Transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
Tokens sent to a contract address may become irretrievable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `to` is not the zero address.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_burn]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_burn++#++(from: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, id: Uint<128>, value: Uint<128>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Destroys a `value` amount of tokens of type `token_id` from `from`.

NOTE: Transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents assets from being inadvertently locked in contracts that cannot currently handle token receipt.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `from` must have an `id` balance of at least `value`.

[.contract-item]
[[MultiTokenModule-_setApprovalForAll]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_setApprovalForAll++#++(owner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, operator: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, approved: Boolean) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Enables or disables approval for `operator` to manage all of the caller's assets.
This circuit does not check for access permissions but can be useful as a building block for more complex contract logic.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `operator` is not the zero address.
