[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-initialize]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++initialize++#++(initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Initializes the contract by setting the `initialOwner`.
This must be called in the contract's constructor.

Requirements:

- Contract is not already initialized.
- `initialOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
- `initialOwner` is not the zero address.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-owner]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++owner++#++() → Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the current contract owner.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-transferOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++transferOwnership++#++(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Transfers ownership of the contract to `newOwner`.

NOTE: Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- The caller is the current contract owner.
- `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
- `newOwner` is not the zero address.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-_unsafeTransferOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_unsafeTransferOwnership++#++(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Unsafe variant of <<Ownable-transferOwnership,transferOwnership>>.

WARNING: Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- The caller is the current contract owner.
- `newOwner` is not the zero address.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-renounceOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++renounceOwnership++#++() → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Leaves the contract without an owner.
It will not be possible to call <<Ownable-assertOnlyOwner,assertOnlyOwner>> circuits anymore.
Can only be called by the current owner.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- The caller is the current contract owner.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-assertOnlyOwner]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++assertOnlyOwner++#++() → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
Use this to restrict access of specific circuits to the owner.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- The caller is the current contract owner.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-_transferOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_transferOwnership++#++(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Transfers ownership of the contract to a `newOwner` without enforcing permission checks on the caller.

NOTE: Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.

[.contract-item]
[[Ownable-_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership++#++(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Unsafe variant of <<Ownable-_transferOwnership,_transferOwnership>>.

WARNING: Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
