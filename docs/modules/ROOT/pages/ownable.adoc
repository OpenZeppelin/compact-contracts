= Ownable

An unshielded Ownable library.
This modules provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is an owner
that can be granted exclusive access to specific circuits.

The initial owner must be set by using the xref:api/ownable.adoc#Ownable-initialize[initialize] circuit during construction.
This can later be changed with xref:api/ownable.adoc#Ownable-transferOwnership[transferOwnership].
